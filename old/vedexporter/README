This directory contains code to export log records from the funcX centrally
hosted servers and import them into an sqlite3 database for further querying.

`bisecting-query.py` will make queries to the cloudwatch database and store
the results in `*.json` files in the current directory.

`importer.py` will import those JSON files into funcx.sqlite3

Example queries that can be made:

What is the timestamp of the most recent log entry?

```
select unixepoch(substr(json_extract(entry, "$.asctime"),1,19)) as t from awslog order by t desc limit 1;
1668745039
```
